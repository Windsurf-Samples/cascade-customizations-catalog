- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use secure coding practices to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks
- Implement proper session management
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Use secure random number generators for cryptographic operations
