Systematic approach to debugging infrastructure issues:

## Initial Assessment

1. **Reproduce the issue**
   - Document exact steps to reproduce
   - Note environment where issue occurs
   - Gather error messages and stack traces

2. **Check logs**
   - Application logs
   - Server logs
   - Database logs
   - Third-party service logs

## Investigation Steps

3. **Analyze error messages**
   - Read stack traces carefully
   - Identify the root cause vs symptoms
   - Check for common patterns

4. **Check recent changes**
   - Review recent deployments
   - Check configuration changes
   - Review code changes in affected areas

5. **Isolate the problem**
   - Use debugging tools (debugger, profiler)
   - Add temporary logging statements
   - Test with minimal reproduction case

## Resolution

6. **Implement fix**
   - Make targeted changes
   - Avoid broad modifications
   - Document the fix

7. **Test thoroughly**
   - Verify fix resolves the issue
   - Test edge cases
   - Run regression tests

8. **Deploy and monitor**
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Monitor for any new issues
   - Update documentation if needed

## Prevention

9. **Post-mortem analysis**
   - Document root cause
   - Identify prevention measures
   - Update monitoring/alerting if needed
