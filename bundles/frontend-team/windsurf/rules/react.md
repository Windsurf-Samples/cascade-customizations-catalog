React development guidelines:
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript interfaces
- Follow the single responsibility principle for components
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when appropriate
- Implement proper error boundaries for error handling
- Use custom hooks to extract and reuse stateful logic
- Follow consistent naming conventions for components and props
