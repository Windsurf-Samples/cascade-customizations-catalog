description: Apply React best practices when working with React components and hooks
---

When working with React code, follow these practices:
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when appropriate
- Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level)
- Use custom hooks to extract and reuse stateful logic
- Implement proper error boundaries for error handling
- Use TypeScript with React for better type safety
- Follow component composition patterns over inheritance
